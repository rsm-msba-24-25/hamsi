When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable.

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"

the success of the random assignment in this field experiment, we compare characteristics of the treatment and control groups before any intervention. This ensures that the groups were balanced at baseline and that any post-treatment differences can be interpreted causally.\nWe focus on four pre-treatment variables: - mrm2 — Months since last donation - hpa — Highest previous contribution - years — Years since first donation - freq — Number of previous donations\nFor each, we: - Conduct a t-test comparing means between treatment and control - Run a linear regression of the form: variable ~ treatment\nThis balance check corresponds to the purpose of Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), which confirms that randomization produced statistically comparable groups at baseline.\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Variables to test\nvars &lt;- c(\"mrm2\", \"hpa\", \"years\", \"freq\")\n\n# Run t-tests and regressions\nt_test_results &lt;- list()\nlm_results &lt;- list()\n\nfor (var in vars) {\n  t_test_results[[var]] &lt;- tidy(t.test(data[[var]] ~ data$treatment, var.equal = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n    select(statistic, p.value, estimate1, estimate2) %&gt;%\n    mutate(variable = var)\n\n  lm_results[[var]] &lt;- tidy(lm(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)) %&gt;%\n    filter(term == \"treatment\") %&gt;%\n    select(term, estimate, statistic, p.value) %&gt;%\n    mutate(variable = var)\n}\n\n# Combine into tables\nt_test_df &lt;- bind_rows(t_test_results)\nlm_df &lt;- bind_rows(lm_results)\n\n# Display results\nkable(t_test_df, caption = \"T-Test Results: Mean Comparison Between Treatment and Control\")\n\n\n\nT-Test Results: Mean Comparison Between Treatment and Control\n\n\nstatistic\np.value\nestimate1\nestimate2\nvariable\n\n\n\n\n-0.1194921\n0.9048860\n12.998142\n13.011828\nmrm2\n\n\n-0.9441476\n0.3450988\n58.960167\n59.597243\nhpa\n\n\n1.1030384\n0.2700158\n6.135914\n6.078365\nyears\n\n\n0.1108930\n0.9117017\n8.047342\n8.035364\nfreq\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nkable(lm_df, caption = \"Regression Results: Variable ~ Treatment\")\n\n\n\nRegression Results: Variable ~ Treatment\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nvariable\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n0.0136859\n0.1194921\n0.9048860\nmrm2\n\n\ntreatment\n0.6370753\n0.9441476\n0.3450988\nhpa\n\n\ntreatment\n-0.0575492\n-1.1030384\n0.2700158\nyears\n\n\ntreatment\n-0.0119787\n-0.1108930\n0.9117017\nfreq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary on Results\nThe t-tests show no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups across all four pre-treatment variables — all p-values are well above the 0.05 threshold. The regression results reinforce this, with all coefficients on the treatment variable being small and statistically insignificant.\n\n\nComparison to Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007)\nTable 1 in the Karlan & List (2007) paper presents descriptive statistics for both groups prior to intervention. Its purpose is to validate the randomization mechanism by showing that observable characteristics were balanced.\nIn this replication, we used both t-tests and regressions to assess balance on the same kinds of baseline variables. Our findings confirm that: - No variable tested showed a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level. - This supports the idea that randomization worked, and we can attribute post-treatment differences to the treatment itself (e.g., letter type), not to pre-existing group differences.\n\n\nWhy Table 1 Matters\nTable 1 is essential in experimental work because: - It reassures the reader that the experimental design was sound. - It strengthens the causal interpretation of post-treatment outcomes. - It enhances replicability and transparency by showing descriptive stats up front.\nThis balance check gives us confidence to move forward and analyze treatment effects without concerns of baseline bias."

Specifically, we assess:\n\nWhether receiving a matched donation offer increases the likelihood of donating.\nWhether it affects the amount donated.\nWhether the match size (e.g., 1:1 vs. 2:1 or 3:1) influences giving behavior.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the response rate — the proportion of individuals who made any donation.\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\n\n\n\n\n\nWe begin by evaluating whether receiving a matched donation offer influences the likelihood of making a charitable contribution. To do this, we compute the proportion of individuals who donated in each group — treatment vs. control — and display the results in a bar chart.\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# Prepare data\ndonation_rates &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = ifelse(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\"))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(donation_rates, aes(x = Group, y = Proportion, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of People Who Donated\",\n    x = \"Group\",\n    y = \"Proportion Donated\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),\n    breaks = seq(0, 0.03, by = 0.01),\n    limits = c(0, 0.03)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Donors in Treatment vs Control Groups\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot above shows that the treatment group, who received a matched donation appeal, had a higher donation rate than the control group. Although the absolute differences appear modest, the increase suggests that the presence of a match offer does positively influence the decision to donate.\nThis provides early evidence that matching appeals can be an effective tool in encouraging participation, even before examining donation amounts or match sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# Prepare data\ndonation_rates &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = ifelse(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\"))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(donation_rates, aes(x = Group, y = Proportion, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of People Who Donated\",\n    x = \"Group\",\n    y = \"Proportion Donated\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),     # show 0%, 1%, 2%, ...\n    breaks = seq(0, 0.03, by = 0.01),           # adjust if needed (e.g., up to 3%)\n    limits = c(0, 0.03)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot above displays the proportion of individuals who made a charitable contribution in each group. The treatment group, who received a matched donation appeal, shows a higher donation rate compared to the\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# T-test on donation (binary outcome)\ngave_ttest &lt;- t.test(gave ~ treatment, data = data, var.equal = TRUE)\ngave_ttest_result &lt;- tidy(gave_ttest)\n\n# Linear regression: probability of giving ~ treatment\ngave_lm &lt;- lm(gave ~ treatment, data = data)\ngave_lm_result &lt;- tidy(gave_lm)\n\n# Output results\ngave_ttest_result\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.00418    0.0179    0.0220     -3.10 0.00193     50081 -0.00682  -0.00154\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\ngave_lm_result\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  0.0179    0.00110     16.2  4.78e-59\n2 treatment    0.00418   0.00135      3.10 1.93e- 3\n\n\nThe t-test and linear regression both confirm that the treatment group was more likely to make a donation than the control group. The difference was statistically significant at the 5% level.\nThis means that people who received a letter mentioning matching donations were more likely to respond than those who received a standard letter. The matched appeal likely triggered a stronger sense of urgency or moral obligation, encouraging action.\nIn terms of human behavior, this finding supports the idea that social cues or perceived impact (e.g., “your donation will be matched”) can effectively motivate charitable giving.\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.

The coefficient on the treatment variable is positive and statistically significant, confirming that being in the treatment group increases the likelihood of giving.\nThe intercept’s p-value, although rounded to 0 in some summaries, is in fact a very small value (e.g., &lt; 2e-16), confirming a significant baseline probability of giving even without the treatment.\nThese results replicate Table 3, Column 1 of Karlan & List (2007), and reinforce the conclusion that matching donation appeals significantly influence charitable behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not.

The presence of a match seems to be more important than the size of the match. This aligns with the authors’ conclusion that larger match offers do not drive significantly higher donor response rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status.

We compare average donation amounts between treatment and control groups using both a t-test and a simple linear regression.\nThe results indicate that [insert here: e.g., “the average donation amount is slightly higher in the treatment group, but the difference is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05).”].\nThis suggests that while the presence of a matched donation offer may encourage more people to donate, it does not necessarily cause them to donate larger amounts. Therefore, the main effect of the treatment appears to be on participation, not intensity of giving.\nThese findings are consistent with the idea that matched appeals trigger an on/off decision to give, but may not affect how much donors are willing to contribute.\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn?

This regression is conditional on giving, and donation behavior is not randomly assigned within that group. The treatment may affect who donates, and those who do may be systematically different from those who don’t — violating the assumptions of causal inference.\nSo while this tells us something interesting about donor behavior, we cannot interpret the treatment effect on donation size as causal.\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control.

Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”\n\nset.seed(123)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Step 1: Filter to donors only\ndonors &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\n# Step 2: Extract treatment and control donation amounts\ncontrol &lt;- donors %&gt;% filter(treatment == 0) %&gt;% pull(amount)\ntreatment &lt;- donors %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1) %&gt;% pull(amount)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the true difference in means\ntrue_diff &lt;- mean(treatment) - mean(control)\n\n# Step 4: Simulation function\nsimulate_differences &lt;- function(n, reps = 1000) {\n  replicate(reps, {\n    mean(sample(treatment, n, replace = TRUE)) -\n      mean(sample(control, n, replace = TRUE))\n  })\n}\n\n# Step 5: Simulate differences for each sample size\ndiffs_50 &lt;- simulate_differences(50)\ndiffs_200 &lt;- simulate_differences(200)\ndiffs_500 &lt;- simulate_differences(500)\ndiffs_1000 &lt;- simulate_differences(1000)\n\n# Step 6: Plotting function\nplot_histogram &lt;- function(diffs, n, binwidth = 1.5) {\n  ggplot(data.frame(diff = diffs), aes(x = diff)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = binwidth, fill = \"#4B9CD3\", color = \"white\") +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = true_diff, color = \"darkgreen\", linetype = \"dotted\", linewidth = 1) +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Sample Size:\", n),\n      x = \"Difference in Mean\\nDonations (Treatment - Control)\",\n      y = \"Density\"\n    ) +\n    xlim(-10, 10) +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11),\n      axis.text = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray20\")\n    )\n}\n\n# Step 7: Generate plots\np50 &lt;- plot_histogram(diffs_50, 50)\np200 &lt;- plot_histogram(diffs_200, 200)\np500 &lt;- plot_histogram(diffs_500, 500)\np1000 &lt;- plot_histogram(diffs_1000, 1000)\n\n# Step 8: Combine plots into a 2x2 layout\n(p50 | p200) / (p500 | p1000)\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 240 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\nRemoved 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots demonstrate how the sampling distribution of the mean difference evolves as sample size increases. With larger sample sizes, the distributions become more concentrated and normal-shaped, and the mean difference becomes more reliably centered around the true treatment effect (green line), moving further from zero (red line). This is a visual demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem in action."

randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\ntodo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Variables to test\nvars &lt;- c(\"mrm2\", \"hpa\", \"years\", \"freq\")\n\n# Create empty lists to hold results\nt_test_results &lt;- list()\nlm_results &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through variables\nfor (var in vars) {\n  # --- T-TEST ---\n  ttest_result &lt;- t.test(data[[var]] ~ data$treatment, var.equal = TRUE)\n  t_test_results[[var]] &lt;- tidy(ttest_result) %&gt;%\n    select(statistic, p.value, estimate1, estimate2) %&gt;%\n    mutate(variable = var)\n  \n  # --- REGRESSION ---\n  lm_model &lt;- lm(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)\n  lm_results[[var]] &lt;- tidy(lm_model) %&gt;%\n    filter(term == \"treatment\") %&gt;%\n    select(term, estimate, statistic, p.value) %&gt;%\n    mutate(variable = var)\n}\n\n# Combine into final tables\nt_test_df &lt;- bind_rows(t_test_results)\nlm_df &lt;- bind_rows(lm_results)\n\n# Show results\ncat(\"##  T-Test Results (Means Comparison)\\n\")\n\n##  T-Test Results (Means Comparison)\n\nt_test_df\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  statistic p.value estimate1 estimate2 variable\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1    -0.119   0.905     13.0      13.0  mrm2    \n2    -0.944   0.345     59.0      59.6  hpa     \n3     1.10    0.270      6.14      6.08 years   \n4     0.111   0.912      8.05      8.04 freq    \n\ncat(\"\\n## Regression Results (Y ~ treatment)\\n\")\n\n\n## Regression Results (Y ~ treatment)\n\nlm_df\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term      estimate statistic p.value variable\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 treatment   0.0137     0.119   0.905 mrm2    \n2 treatment   0.637      0.944   0.345 hpa     \n3 treatment  -0.0575    -1.10    0.270 years   \n4 treatment  -0.0120    -0.111   0.912 freq    \n\n\n\n\nComparison to Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007)\nTable 1 in the Karlan & List (2007) paper provides descriptive statistics for both treatment and control groups before the intervention. Its main purpose is to validate the randomization mechanism by showing that the two groups were similar across observable characteristics.\nIn this replication, we tested four pre-treatment variables:\n\nmrm2 – Months since last donation\n\nhpa – Highest previous contribution\n\nyears – Years since first donation\n\nfreq – Number of previous donations\n\nFor each variable, we: - Conducted a t-test to compare means between treatment and control - Ran a linear regression of the form: variable ~ treatment\n\nCommentary on Results\nAll p-values from both the t-tests and regressions were above 0.05, indicating that none of the differences were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\nThis supports the conclusion that randomization was successful, mirroring the findings in Table 1 of the original paper. Baseline equivalence allows us to attribute post-treatment differences in donation behavior to the effect of the fundraising letter types, not pre-existing differences between groups.\n\n\nWhy Table 1 Matters\nTable 1 plays a crucial role because: - It reassures readers that the experimental design was sound. - It strengthens the causal interpretation of later results. - It provides replicability and transparency via descriptive stats for key variables."

Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# T-test on donation (binary outcome)\ngave_ttest &lt;- t.test(gave ~ treatment, data = data, var.equal = TRUE)\ngave_ttest_result &lt;- tidy(gave_ttest)\n\n# Linear regression: probability of giving ~ treatment\ngave_lm &lt;- lm(gave ~ treatment, data = data)\ngave_lm_result &lt;- tidy(gave_lm)\n\n# Output results\ngave_ttest_result\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.00418    0.0179    0.0220     -3.10 0.00193     50081 -0.00682  -0.00154\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\ngave_lm_result\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  0.0179    0.00110     16.2  4.78e-59\n2 treatment    0.00418   0.00135      3.10 1.93e- 3\n\n\nThe t-test and linear regression both confirm that the treatment group was more likely to make a donation than the control group. The difference was statistically significant at the 5% level.\nThis means that people who received a letter mentioning matching donations were more likely to respond than those who received a standard letter. The matched appeal likely triggered a stronger sense of urgency or moral obligation, encouraging action.\nIn terms of human behavior, this finding supports the idea that social cues or perceived impact (e.g., “your donation will be matched”) can effectively motivate charitable giving.\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n# Load needed library\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Run a probit model: gave ~ treatment\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), data = data)\n\n# Tidy and display results\nprobit_result &lt;- tidy(probit_model)\nprobit_result\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  -2.10      0.0233    -90.1  0      \n2 treatment     0.0868    0.0279      3.11 0.00185\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences.

To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"
